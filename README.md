# Earthbound3D

# Overview

The game is a 3rd person 3d action/adventure game. It is based on inspiration gathered from Earthbound the SNES game. 

I started making this just because I wish this game existed in real life. 

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the game being played and a walkthrough of the code.}

# Development Environment

I used unity as the game editor and VS code for any scripting purposes. The scripts were written/generated in c++.
